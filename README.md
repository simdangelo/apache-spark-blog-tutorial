# Introduction

This repository serves as a storage space for code examples related to a series of tutorials on Apache Spark available on my blog. The tutorials focus on various topics, aiming to provide clear and concise explanations about basics of the framework alongside practical code demonstrations. The repository contains directories corresponding to each tutorial, where you can find the code examples discussed in the respective tutorials. Please feel free to point out errors to me (which will certainly be there). Here's the link to my blog: https://simdangelo.github.io/.
